# Total Recall: a Customized Continual Learning Method for Neural Semantic Parsers
This is the code for the EMNLP2021 paper, Total Recall: a Customized Continual Learning Method for Neural Semantic Parsers. This work investigates continual learning for semantic parsing. 

I am recently busy with several deadlines. If anyone is confused with this code, please send emails to zhuang.li@monash.edu or open an issue. Will clean the code later.
