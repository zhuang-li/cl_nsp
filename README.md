# Total Recall: a Customized Continual Learning Method for Neural Semantic Parsers
This is the code for the EMNLP2021 paper, [[Total Recall: a Customized Continual Learning Method for Neural Semantic Parsers]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.05186). This work investigates continual learning for semantic parsing. 

### to-do 

realease the code and cleaned datasets before EMNLP conference
